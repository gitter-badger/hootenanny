/**
 * @todo If it is 2015 and this class still isn't in use, delete it.
 *
 * This class will reserve a number of ids at one time for a given sequence name and then return
 * one at a time. When it runs out another block will be reserved.
 *
 * #############
 * ## CAUTION ##
 * #############
 *
 * This class contains a race condition. If you have multiple threads/processes all reserving ids
 * at the same time (likely) then you can occassionally (like 1 in 20000 bulk reservers on my
 * machine) will result in a bad reservation and possibly duplicate ids being assigned.
 *
 * From this you should read "Don't use me unless you really know what is going on!" I'm leaving
 * the code here in case it is useful in the future when we determine a better approach.
