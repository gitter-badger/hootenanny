/**
 * Useful when connecting nodes that make up a GPS track into a way.
 *
 * Any nodes that contain both "hoot:track:id" and "hoot:track:seq" keys will be grouped into
 * tracks, ordered and then placed into a way.
 *
 * The "hoot:track:id" tag specifies what track the node is part of. The id is treated as a string.
 *
 * The "hoot:track:seq" tag specifies the sequence of the nodes in the way. This is sorted
 * as a string so make sure you don't have string likes "13" and "112". Padding with 0 or spaces
 * should do the trick. I've also noticed some data sets us the date for the sequence. Please
 * be aware that the date string may only have second precision and may cause issues.
 *
 * @note If the nodes all contain the same highway tag then the highway tag will be added to the
 * way and removed from all the nodes. This is a bit of convenient hard coding.
